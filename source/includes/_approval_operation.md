#Approval and Operation

##Prerequisites
[Current terms of services for developers](https://apm.fidor.de/developer/terms_of_services/current)

(-see Developer AGB, e.g. full KYC account) @Stefan: please provide texts

##Self Approval
So called - "self-serve" applications - the ones you created for yourself to access your own account. This kind of applications will automatically get approved. You will get a notification about the your application being available in live environment and can start using it immediately

Applications that meet the "Self-API" conditions can go live immediately.

##Manual Approval Process
The applications that may need an access to a foreign account. This type of applications will have to undergo an approval process. Before your application will go into the approval process, you will have to sign an additional agreement/contact. (Stefan Wei√ü  do we have something like this already?) You will get notified in every step of the approval process. 

In most cases the application has to be reviewed before it is allowed to access the live system.

During the beta phase all applications that are able to submit payments, will have to undergo our review.

##Statistics
We will provide you with statistics for your app in the near future. To give you a little bit more of the insight, some of the statistics might be:

* Overall number of installs
* Number of 'active' users
* Number of new installs in the last 30 days/7 days
* Number of 'active' users in the last 30 days/7 days
* Overall number of requests
* Number of requests per endpoint/app function/user
 *  e.g. number of transactions - internal/credit card etc.
 *  e.g. number of account checks (get transactions)
 
##Check API Logs
For you to being able to see what your app is doing, we offer you the ability to see and analyze the log files directly in the App Manager. Every app you create gets an "API Logs" view, where you see the requests your app is doing, the traffic your app is creating etc.
