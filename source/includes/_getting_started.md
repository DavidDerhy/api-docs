# Getting Started
Welcome to the Fidor APIs, your direct access to the functions and services of the world's most innovative Bank. Fidor Bank.
To get started you just need a (free) Fidor Account.

## Create a Fidor Account
To create a Fidor account visit Fidor Bank webpage [Fidor DE](https://fidor.de), and register your account.  In order to start testing our APIs you don't need to be fully verified.

Please do not confuse the Fidor Account with the Developer Community Account you need if you want to take part in the discussion in [Developer Community Forums](https://developer.fidor.de/community/).

## Creating an Application

To start using Fidor's API you have to register (create) your application. In order to do so, please login with your Fidor bank account's credentials into the [Application Manager](https://apm.fidor.de/) and select "Add New App". If you log in for the first time you have to accept the Developer Agreement first.

After that you can create as many applications as you want. For every new application a dedicated sandbox environment (account simulation) is created. The sandbox comes with some test data, so that you can start developing your application against the sandbox immediately.

A sandbox user is created along the way. A sandbox user is required during the authentication against the sandbox. 

Our sandbox environment offers you the same functionality as the live API. So once developed and tested against the sandbox environment, your application will be production ready.

### Using Starter Kits
Fidor Starter Kits have been created with an idea to help you developing your application immediately. When you create an application in the Application Manager then you immediately getting access to already configured example application. Until now we provide example application for following programming languages/frameworks:

- ruby/sinatra
- php (plain)
- java/servlet
- Node.js
- Go

[Our starter kits](https://github.com/fidor/fidor_starter_kits) are also available as a ruby gem on github.
