# Getting Started

To participate in developer program of Fidor Bank AG you have to be a customer of Fidor Bank AG and have an account at [https://fidor.de](https://fidor.de) or [https://fidorbank.uk](https://fidorbank.uk)

Every full KYC Fidor Bank customer can become a developer by agreeing to the [developer's agreement](https://apm.fidor.de/developer/terms_of_services/current). 

You need to have a full account at Fidor in order to pay for services provided by Fidor TecS AG related to usage of the Fidor APIs. 

The developer tools: [API-Browser](https://developer.fidortecs.com/api-browser/), [fidor_schema](https://github.com/fidor/fidor_schema), [fidor_starter_kits](https://github.com/fidor/fidor_starter_kits), [application manager](https://apm.fidor.de/), sandbox environment and [developer community](https://developer.fidor.de/)  are provided free of charge. You only pay for API usage.

To start developing against Fidor's API you have to create your App first. In order to do so, please login with your Fidor bank account's credentials into the [application manager](https://apm.fidor.de/), accept the developer agreement and add new App.

## Create a Fidor Account
To create a fidor account visit Fidor bank webpage [Fidor DE](https://fidor.de), [Fidor UK](https://fidorbank.uk), [Fidor RU](https://fidor.ru) and register your account.
In order to start creating applications you don't need to be fully verified.

## Creating an Application

Creating a new application is really easy. Visit the [Application Manager](https://apm.fidor.de/) page, login with your banking credentials and accept the developer agreement. After that you can create as many applications as you want.

For every new application a dedicated sandbox environment is created. The sandbox comes with some test data, so that you can start developing your application against the sandbox immediately.

A sandbox user is created along the way. A sandbox user is required during the authentication against the sandbox.

Our sandbox environment offers you the same functionality as the API. So once developed and tested against the sandbox environment, you application will be production ready.

### Using Starter Kits
Fidor Starter Kits have been created with an idea to help you developing your app immediately. When you create an app in the Application Manager then you immediately getting access to already configured example apps. Until now we provide example apps for following programming languages/frameworks:

- ruby/sinatra
- php (plain)
- java/servlet
- Node.js
- Go

[Our starter kits](https://github.com/fidor/fidor_starter_kits) are also available as a ruby gem on github.
